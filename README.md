# PHP WordPress Project

Creating a custom post type is very useful when creating content that has a different format than a standard post or page.

I have created a Custom post type for Industry Reports with the category (custom taxonomy) and created a custom template with search functionality. The idea is that I want to add additional functionality to my website but don't want to add everything as a standard post. for that, I have created a custom post type with taxonomy. I have creted custom meta field for all other information for post.

This can be done with multiple logic but I decided to do with this way because the code looks clean, simple, and very easy to understand, I like clean code for that I deleted a few lines and made the code faster and ready for the new feature.

Please check the below files for my code:
